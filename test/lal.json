    "explanation": "Shehab Ahamed has a strong technical background in programming languages like Python and Java, relevant for data analysis, but lacks direct data analysis experience. Experience with SQL and MongoDB is beneficial, yet there is no mention of data analysis tools or libraries like Pandas or NumPy, indicating a learning curve in technical skills (rating 4/10). Experience level is slightly above entry, with significant integration and software engineering experience, but not specifically in data analysis (rating 6/10). Domain relevance is low as prior roles focus on software development and integration rather than data analysis (rating 3/10). Soft skills indicate strong client-facing and support capabilities, which can be valuable in cross-functional data teams (rating 7/10)."
