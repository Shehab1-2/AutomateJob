Recent advances in medical and digital technology combined with changing consumer expectations provide an opportunity to refocus attention on this important and evolving approach. Self-care interventions, particularly in the realm of sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), have transformative potential to increase individuals\u2019 autonomy in making decisions about their own care, strengthen countries\u2019 health systems, and ultimately pave the way toward universal health coverage (UHC).<br><br>In 2022, the World Health Organization (WHO) released the WHO guideline on self-care interventions for health and well-being building on the global guidance published in 2019. This guideline includes people-centered, evidence-based recommendations to support individuals, communities, and countries with quality health services and self-care interventions, as a critical pathway to achieving universal health coverage.<br><br>The WHO released Implementations of self-care interventions for health and well-being in 2023 to build upon the normative recommendations and offer key considerations to support the introduction and scale-up of self-care interventions in countries, at the national or subnational level.

The SCTG is focused on expanding the safe and effective practice of self-care to ensure individuals can better manage their own health, health outcomes are improved, and health systems are more resilient and better equipped to achieve UHC. By improving the enabling environment for self-care, particularly through policy development, the SCTG aims for self-care to be institutionalized into policy and integrated into national health systems. The SCTG works with global, regional, national, and local partners to achieve this goal and the outcomes contributing to it. Population Services International (PSI) serves as the Secretariat of the SCTG.<br><br>The SCTG operates both as a coalition and a set of related programs:<br><br><ul><li> The SCTG\u2019s coalition function is responsible for (1) building a coordinated, diverse, and influential self-care movement mobilized around common evidence, goals, and messaging to advance self-care, and (2) increasing awareness and support for quality, evidence-based self-care among self-care influencers, policymakers, and potential opposition. The coalition functions include individual and organizational members, a Coalition Steering Committee (CSC), the Evidence and Learning Working Group (ELWG), the Advocacy and Communications Working Group, and the Self-Care Learning Lab. </li><li> The SCTG\u2019s programmatic function aims to advance (1) the institutionalization of self-care policies and financing at national and subnational levels and (2) increase the demand and accountability for self-care among target communities and constituencies.

The National Self-Care Networks (NSNs) are Ministry of Health (MOH) led working groups, which bring together key in-country stakeholders, including civil society organizations working in SRH, health provider associations, academia, country based advocates and implementers, private sector among others, to develop and lead in-country, grassroots self-care advocacy efforts and serve as models for guideline adoption and implementation efforts in subsequent countries.<br><br>All five focus countries, have made significant progress through establishing and convening National Self-Care Networks, that have been instrumental in the development of national self-care guidelines and are at various stages of implementing these guidelines and institutionalizing self-care into their health systems (see SCTG\u2019s learning journey here for more information).<br><br><strong> Scope of Work <br><br></strong><strong> GOAL <br><br></strong>The World Health Organization (WHO) and SCTG are seeking to develop a Self-Care Implementation Toolkit to facilitate the adoption of the WHO self-care recommendations at the country level.
