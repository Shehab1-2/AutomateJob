We mitigate the impact of chronic disease by using technology and a world-class clinical team to remotely monitor, manage, and support patients at home.

Every member of our team plays a role, and you will have an especially big role to play in this position. We can't wait to hear your ideas about how we can do better. If you're looking for a role that gives you ample opportunity to make a big impact -- you've found it! <br><br></li></ul>What You'll Do:<br><br>As BooksTime has grown, so have our IT needs. Therefore, we\u2019re looking to expand our IT department, which currently includes 3 full-time staff.<br><br>The role includes 3 main functions:<br><br><ul><li> Support &amp; Routine Operations, i.e. responding to helpdesk support tickets from other employees, managing staff access and accounts in company systems when team members are onboarded or offboarded, and more. Our staff use over 20 different apps and systems and require a wide range of support. </li><li> Technical Project Management, i.e. working on initiatives to improve our IT systems. This includes automation projects, internal software development, efforts to improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness, and finding ways to increase the user-friendliness of our internal systems. </li><li> Security Assurance, i.e. enhancing security measures to protect our company, staff and clients, monitoring for threats and leading responses to them, staying abreast of the latest in cybersecurity technology, improving policies &amp; procedures, providing training to our staff, and more. <br><br></li></ul>The exact scope of the role will be shaped around the strengths of the person we hire. You might focus on one of the 3 functions above more than the others, depending on where you have the most experience.<br><br>Supervisory Role:<br><br>This role is suitable for an early-career candidate. However, more experienced candidates would be eligible for a more advanced version of this role, which would involve supervising other IT staff and leading larger, more complex initiatives.<br><br>Whether you\u2019re in the supervisory role or not, we really value your ideas and input on everything that we do.<br><br><strong>Requirements<br><br></strong><ul><li>An adaptable, fast learner. We need someone who feels very comfortable diving in and figuring things out. If you are happiest maintaining a well-established process that someone else designed, this is NOT the ideal role for you. If you love looking for creative solutions to new problems, you could be a perfect fit! For this sort of work, there's sometimes no playbook, no step-by-step instructions available. New challenges arise all the time. The work is all about investigating and figuring out each problem, finding creative solutions, and also thinking about ways to head off similar problems in the future. </li><li>Comfortable working mostly independently. There are always people who are happy and eager to help you brainstorm, but there's often nobody else who already knows the answer to some types of questions that come up. Often, someone just has to dive in and figure it out. </li><li>Organized, with good project management skills. You\u2019re great at staying on top of things, planning out complex projects, prioritizing tasks, and meeting deadlines. </li><li>Strong communication skills: You\u2019ll be supporting many colleagues who don\u2019t have an IT background, so you\u2019ll need to be comfortable explaining IT topics to non-technical colleagues. You may also occasionally need to communicate with external parties (clients or partners) via email, which requires a high level of professional written communication skills. </li><li>Comfort with evolving job functions. The core focus of this role will always be IT and security. However, as our company continues to grow, the IT and security needs of the company will continue to evolve, so your exact duties and focus area may change from time to time.  <br><br></li></ul>Preferred (But Not Required):<br><br><ul><li>3+ years of experience in IT management, product/project management, or software development. </li><li>A security clearance (strongly preferred). </li><li>Familiarity with security best practices and systems compliance. </li><li>Cybersecurity certification (none are required, but any of these would be a plus: CEH, GSEC, GMOB, GCFA, CISA, CISM, Comp TIA Security+ or CySA+, CISSP, SSCP, ECSA, LPT, etc.) <br><br></li></ul><strong>Benefits<br><br></strong>Salary Range: Highly dependent on knowledge level, education and location.<br><br><ul><li>For less experienced candidates, the range is approx. $20 to $30 per hour. </li><li>For more experienced candidates, especially those that would join in a supervisory role, higher amounts may be discussed.  <br><br></li></ul>Additional bonuses are possible based on performance.<br><br>Benefits Include:<br><br><ul><li>Flexible schedule; </li><li>Work from home (we are big believers in remote work!); </li><li>Health insurance reimbursement plan (a QSEHRA plan); </li><li>Professional development assistance; </li><li>Simple IRA with employer matching after 2 years; </li><li>Flexible Paid Time Off (PTO) starting at 20 days for full-time employees. <br><br></li></ul>Other Details:<br><br>Time Zones - IMPORTANT: You will need availability each weekday around 9-11am Eastern Time.

Security Assurance, i.e. enhancing security measures to protect our company, staff and clients, monitoring for threats and leading responses to them, staying abreast of the latest in cybersecurity technology, improving policies &amp; procedures, providing training to our staff, and more. The exact scope of the role will be shaped around the strengths of the person we hire. You might focus on one of the 3 functions above more than the others, depending on where you have the most experience.Supervisory Role:This role is suitable for an early-career candidate. However, more experienced candidates would be eligible for a more advanced version of this role, which would involve supervising other IT staff and leading larger, more complex initiatives.Whether you\u2019re in the supervisory role or not, we really value your ideas and input on everything that we do.RequirementsAn adaptable, fast learner. We need someone who feels very comfortable diving in and figuring things out. If you are happiest maintaining a well-established process that someone else designed, this is NOT the ideal role for you. If you love looking for creative solutions to new problems, you could be a perfect fit! For this sort of work, there's sometimes no playbook, no step-by-step instructions available. New challenges arise all the time. The work is all about investigating and figuring out each problem, finding creative solutions, and also thinking about ways to head off similar problems in the future. Comfortable working mostly independently. There are always people who are happy and eager to help you brainstorm, but there's often nobody else who already knows the answer to some types of questions that come up. Often, someone just has to dive in and figure it out. Organized, with good project management skills. You\u2019re great at staying on top of things, planning out complex projects, prioritizing tasks, and meeting deadlines. Strong communication skills: You\u2019ll be supporting many colleagues who don\u2019t have an IT background, so you\u2019ll need to be comfortable explaining IT topics to non-technical colleagues. You may also occasionally need to communicate with external parties (clients or partners) via email, which requires a high level of professional written communication skills. Comfort with evolving job functions. The core focus of this role will always be IT and security. However, as our company continues to grow, the IT and security needs of the company will continue to evolve, so your exact duties and focus area may change from time to time.  Preferred (But Not Required):3+ years of experience in IT management, product/project management, or software development. A security clearance (strongly preferred). Familiarity with security best practices and systems compliance. Cybersecurity certification (none are required, but any of these would be a plus: CEH, GSEC, GMOB, GCFA, CISA, CISM, Comp TIA Security+ or CySA+, CISSP, SSCP, ECSA, LPT, etc.) BenefitsSalary Range: Highly dependent on knowledge level, education and location.For less experienced candidates, the range is approx. $20 to $30 per hour. For more experienced candidates, especially those that would join in a supervisory role, higher amounts may be discussed.  Additional bonuses are possible based on performance.Benefits Include:Flexible schedule; Work from home (we are big believers in remote work!); Health insurance reimbursement plan (a QSEHRA plan); Professional development assistance; Simple IRA with employer matching after 2 years; Flexible Paid Time Off (PTO) starting at 20 days for full-time employees. Other Details:Time Zones - IMPORTANT: You will need availability each weekday around 9-11am Eastern Time. The rest of your schedule can be more flexible.Full-Time/Part-Time: We prefer folks who will start part-time and transition to full-time after at least 1 month. However, it may be possible to start full-time from the beginning.Keywords: IT, Information Technology, Technical Support, Helpdesk, Troubleshooting, InfoSec, Information Security, Cyber, Cybersecurity, Cyber Security, IT Project Manager, Tech Lead, Support, Security Clearance.",

If you greatly desire travel, the need is there, and you will be scheduled at 50% - 26 full weeks \u2013 Monday through Friday. Because this is undesirable to many the target is at least 18 weeks - a 35% requirement. However, based on client and project needs there can be busier times which might average 2-3 weeks a month, but during the slower times it would be closer to 1 week a month.

In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say \"key,\" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).<br><br></em><em>The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.<br><br></em><em>I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.\"<br><br></em><strong>How You Will Make An Impact<br><br></strong><ul><li>Partner with marketing, product, and business development teams to integrate customer performance insights into user and partner acquisition strategies</li><li>Lead the design, execution, and analysis of A/B experiments on new and existing features, extracting key insights to inform product and business strategies</li><li>Define, understand, and test levers to drive profitable and scalable user acquisition and partnership growth</li><li>Identify opportunities to automate manual processes and optimize operational efficiency <br><br></li></ul><strong>Preferred Experience<br><br></strong><ul><li>Bachelor\u2019s degree in a quantitatively or intellectually rigorous discipline</li><li>1-3 years of management consulting experience from a top firm (McKinsey, Bain, and Boston Consulting Group preferred) OR relevant experience in data science/business analysis</li><li>High level of comfort with SQL or Python<br><br></li></ul><strong>Who You Are<br><br></strong><ul><li>You have a framework for problem solving and live by first principles</li><li>You are comfortable communicating with audiences varying from front-line employees to the company\u2019s C-suite</li><li>You set a very high bar for yourself and for your team, and you are constantly pushing that bar higher in the pursuit of excellence<br><br></li></ul><em>While we appreciate your interest and application, only applicants under consideration will be contacted.<br><br></em><em>Jerry.ai is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity employer.

    "descriptionText": "You could be a data scientist anywhere. Why us?Join a pre-IPO startup with capital, traction and runway ($240M funded | 60X revenue growth in 5 years | $2T market size)Partner with our VP of Data Science &amp; Analytics, Armando La Rocca (ex-BCG, Better)Disrupt a massive market and take us to a $10B business in the next few yearsBe immersed in a talent-dense environment and greatly accelerate your career growthAbout The OpportunityJerry is looking for a Data scientist to join our growing team! We hit a huge milestone in early 2024 by achieving profitability and have ambitious goals for the next few years \u2014 scale from 5M to 50M customers and become a $10B business. As a data scientist, you will play a key role in championing data-driven decisions across the company\u2019s most critical business initiatives (including carrier growth and development, building new products from 0-1, etc.). As part of the data science &amp; analytics team, you will leverage advanced machine learning models to conduct in-depth analyses and extract insights that will shape our growth strategies.Jerry is building the first super app to make car ownership affordable and accessible \u2013 insurance, buy/sell, registration, loans, safety, repairs, parking, etc \u2013 a $2T market in the U.S. We started with insurance in 2019, and since then we\u2019ve launched loan refinancing, driving insights, repair marketplace, car diagnostics, and a GenAI-powered chatbot &amp; voicebot. We have amassed over 5M customers, raised $240MM in funding, scaled our revenue 60X and our team to 225 across 6 countries.Here's what an ex-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry:\"The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say \"key,\" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.\"How You Will Make An ImpactPartner with marketing, product, and business development teams to integrate customer performance insights into user and partner acquisition strategiesLead the design, execution, and analysis of A/B experiments on new and existing features, extracting key insights to inform product and business strategiesDefine, understand, and test levers to drive profitable and scalable user acquisition and partnership growthIdentify opportunities to automate manual processes and optimize operational efficiency Preferred ExperienceBachelor\u2019s degree in a quantitatively or intellectually rigorous discipline1-3 years of management consulting experience from a top firm (McKinsey, Bain, and Boston Consulting Group preferred) OR relevant experience in data science/business analysisHigh level of comfort with SQL or PythonWho You AreYou have a framework for problem solving and live by first principlesYou are comfortable communicating with audiences varying from front-line employees to the company\u2019s C-suiteYou set a very high bar for yourself and for your team, and you are constantly pushing that bar higher in the pursuit of excellenceWhile we appreciate your interest and application, only applicants under consideration will be contacted.Jerry.ai is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity employer.

This role pays in the $70K - $90K range based on experience and location, includes a 12% annual bonus program, a strong benefit program and requires extensive travel based on team/role (See Below). Company headquarters are located in Brookfield, WI, but this role can be based at any location in the US and is \u201cWORK FROM HOME\u201d when not traveling to client locations. Home base is suggested to be near a major airport anywhere in the EASTERN Time Zones. </p><p><br></p><p>The key to this role is the ability to learn Tridium/Niagara (N4) software and the ability to create control databases, user interfaces and perform setup of control systems based on project specifications and/or sales proposals. Senior Engineers will mentor this position which will shadow to begin and grow to manage projects and clients on their own. Incumbents of this role will also:</p><ul><li>Understand building controls and HVAC systems and their terminology.</li><li>Deliver setup and operation of Windows-based computers and desktop applications such as MS-Word and MS-Excel.</li><li>Use proficiency in reading BAS and MEP drawings to determine if the drawing and programming required will work together.</li><li>Perform field startup and system commissioning tasks.</li><li>Provide on-site and remote technical support to installers and customers.</li><li>Create programming logic using flow diagrams, sequences of operation, understanding panel layouts, termination details and project specifications or sales proposal.</li><li>Program control applications using various software tools to support operator workstations, DDC field panels and third-party integration devices connected through multiple communications protocols.</li><li>Deliver on-site and remote installation of software and control programs.</li><li>Perform job site system checkout, commissioning and testing of control applications to verify proper operation according to project specifications, sales proposal and design documentation.</li><li>Develop system user interfaces, according to project specifications or sales proposal.</li><li>Help to deliver on-site and remote end user training for the use of the installed system.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>QUALIFICATIONS</strong> <em> </em></p><ul><li>Bachelor\u2019s Degree in HVAC, Electrical, or Mechanical Engineering </li><li>Internship, study or experience in Building Automation Controls, Building Automation Sales, and/or Account/Project Management.</li><li>Internship, study or experience in Field Device Programming with any of the following: Distech / Alerton / Schneider Electric / Johnson Controls / Siemens / Honeywell.</li><li>Ability to learn Tridium Niagara 4 / Niagara AX software <strong> </strong></li><li>Understanding/Study of Knowledge of HVAC System Sequences including Rooftop / Air Handling / Central Plants</li><li>Proficiency with desktop applications such as MS-Word and MS-Excel.</li><li>Knowledge of Google drive and its associated applications is a plus.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>TRAVEL INFO</strong></p><p>This role requires travel at some degree but this is very much based on projects/clients and team makeup. If you greatly desire travel, the need is there, and you will be scheduled at 50% - 26 full weeks \u2013 Monday through Friday. Because this is undesirable to many the target is at least 18 weeks - a 35% requirement. However, based on client and project needs there can be busier times which might average 2-3 weeks a month, but during the slower times it would be closer to 1 week a month.
