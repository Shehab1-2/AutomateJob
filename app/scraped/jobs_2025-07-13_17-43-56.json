While we\u2019re known as a pioneer in quantitative investing, we also have considerable expertise in areas that involve fundamental analysis or portfolio manager discretion. We use a combination of quantitative and qualitative tools to uncover independent, hard-to-find sources of return across global public and private markets.\n\nFounded in 1988 over a small bookstore in downtown New York City, the D. E. Shaw group began with six employees and $28 million in capital and quickly became a pioneer in computational finance. In the early days of exposed pipes and extension cords, tripping on a cable could take out our whole trading system. Today, the firm has more than 2,500 people around the globe and an institutional-grade (and trip-proof) infrastructure, but we still value creativity, entrepreneurship, and the spirit of discovery.\n\nIf you\u2019re an intellectually adventurous person who loves to collaborate on challenging and rewarding projects, we encourage you to apply.

    "descriptionHtml": "<strong>Who We Are<br><br></strong>Our mission is to make the world programmable. Sight is one of the key ways we understand the world, and soon this will be true for the software we use, too.<br><br>At Roboflow, we\u2019re building the tools, community, and resources needed to make the world programmable with artificial intelligence. Roboflow simplifies building and using computer vision models. Today, over 1M developers, including those from half the Fortune 100, use Roboflow\u2019s machine learning open source and hosted tools. That includes counting cells to accelerate cancer research, improving construction site safety, digitizing floor plans, preserving coral reef populations, guiding drone flight, and much more.<br><br>Our team is small relative to our impact, and we believe our user success is our success (not the inverse). A team member summarized: \u201cRoboflow is a company full of giant brains and tiny egos.\u201d We find software has a multiplier effect on all roles (not only product and engineering), so Roboflow employs developers across the company in design, sales, customer support, marketing, and beyond.<br><br>We\u2019re supported by great customers and investors, having raised over $63 million from Google Ventures (check out our Series B announcement here!), Y Combinator, Craft Ventures, Sam Altman, Lachy Groom, amongst other leading software investors.<br><br><strong>What We're Looking For<br><br></strong>Primarily, you like to make great things with passionate colleagues. You are someone that likes to own outcomes, not only inputs. You\u2019re motivated by having responsibility and accountability. You\u2019re eager to \u2018do the work,\u2019 big and small.<br><br>We\u2019re hiring an enterprise focused engineer to help make Roboflow the best possible platform for enterprise computer vision, and expand partnerships with our enterprise customers. You should have strong communication skills, and a track record of success building computer vision applications and a desire to drive innovation in an enterprise setting.<br><br>You\u2019re curious and learning about new technologies, perhaps an early tinkerer with ChatGPT and AI products. You show more than you tell.<br><br>You\u2019re motivated by the question, \u201cHow can I improve this?\u201d and have a track record of doing so, even in ways adjacent to your role. Much of our current team is made up of former founders and thrive in the level of autonomy at Roboflow. Maybe you had a side hustle in high school or college.<br><br>Many Roboflowers have used our tools before joining. One of the best ways to stand out amongst other applicants is to write about something you have built with Roboflow or contribute to one of our open source projects.<br><br><strong>What You'll Do<br><br></strong>As a member of the Enterprise team, you'll be tasked with creating new features and making improvements anywhere in the Roboflow product. We're looking for technical generalists that aren\u2019t afraid to dive into a new stack or toolchain if the need arises (but JavaScript and Node.js make up the brunt of the existing codebase). You will also help support and make improvements to our enterprise Jetson inference pipeline, so a solid foundation in Linux is highly desirable.<br><br>The Enterprise team forms close relationships with Enterprise customers to deeply understand their needs and advance their usage and success with Roboflow. You should expect to frequently be on-site with customers, doing factory tours, and building features needed to make prospective and current customers successful in Computer Vision with Roboflow.<br><br>As a member of the Enterprise team, you will also partner closely with the Field Engineering team. Not only to understand and expand partnerships with customers, but to identify opportunities to make the Field Engineers more efficient in collecting visual data and delivering insights to customers based on that data.<br><br>Most of the things we work on are parts of the core product (which is an end-to-end pipeline for building computer vision projects spanning from image ingestion to annotation to training and deployment) but from time to time we're also working on things like integrating marketing and sales tools, fighting fires, automating internal processes, and open source projects.<br><br>You'll have a wide degree of freedom to advocate for which projects you think should be highest priority and will contribute to increasing engagement and success of enterprise customers. If you need a rigid list of tasks spelled out in a multi-month roadmap, this role probably won't be a good fit.<br><br>The majority of our codebase is written in JavaScript, our machine learning and image processing pipeline is in Python. We run primarily on Firebase and GCS, with some machine learning infrastructure on AWS.

    "descriptionText": "Who We AreOur mission is to make the world programmable. Sight is one of the key ways we understand the world, and soon this will be true for the software we use, too.At Roboflow, we\u2019re building the tools, community, and resources needed to make the world programmable with artificial intelligence. Roboflow simplifies building and using computer vision models. Today, over 1M developers, including those from half the Fortune 100, use Roboflow\u2019s machine learning open source and hosted tools. That includes counting cells to accelerate cancer research, improving construction site safety, digitizing floor plans, preserving coral reef populations, guiding drone flight, and much more.Our team is small relative to our impact, and we believe our user success is our success (not the inverse). A team member summarized: \u201cRoboflow is a company full of giant brains and tiny egos.\u201d We find software has a multiplier effect on all roles (not only product and engineering), so Roboflow employs developers across the company in design, sales, customer support, marketing, and beyond.We\u2019re supported by great customers and investors, having raised over $63 million from Google Ventures (check out our Series B announcement here!), Y Combinator, Craft Ventures, Sam Altman, Lachy Groom, amongst other leading software investors.What We're Looking ForPrimarily, you like to make great things with passionate colleagues. You are someone that likes to own outcomes, not only inputs. You\u2019re motivated by having responsibility and accountability. You\u2019re eager to \u2018do the work,\u2019 big and small.We\u2019re hiring an enterprise focused engineer to help make Roboflow the best possible platform for enterprise computer vision, and expand partnerships with our enterprise customers. You should have strong communication skills, and a track record of success building computer vision applications and a desire to drive innovation in an enterprise setting.You\u2019re curious and learning about new technologies, perhaps an early tinkerer with ChatGPT and AI products. You show more than you tell.You\u2019re motivated by the question, \u201cHow can I improve this?\u201d and have a track record of doing so, even in ways adjacent to your role. Much of our current team is made up of former founders and thrive in the level of autonomy at Roboflow. Maybe you had a side hustle in high school or college.Many Roboflowers have used our tools before joining. One of the best ways to stand out amongst other applicants is to write about something you have built with Roboflow or contribute to one of our open source projects.What You'll DoAs a member of the Enterprise team, you'll be tasked with creating new features and making improvements anywhere in the Roboflow product. We're looking for technical generalists that aren\u2019t afraid to dive into a new stack or toolchain if the need arises (but JavaScript and Node.js make up the brunt of the existing codebase). You will also help support and make improvements to our enterprise Jetson inference pipeline, so a solid foundation in Linux is highly desirable.The Enterprise team forms close relationships with Enterprise customers to deeply understand their needs and advance their usage and success with Roboflow. You should expect to frequently be on-site with customers, doing factory tours, and building features needed to make prospective and current customers successful in Computer Vision with Roboflow.As a member of the Enterprise team, you will also partner closely with the Field Engineering team. Not only to understand and expand partnerships with customers, but to identify opportunities to make the Field Engineers more efficient in collecting visual data and delivering insights to customers based on that data.Most of the things we work on are parts of the core product (which is an end-to-end pipeline for building computer vision projects spanning from image ingestion to annotation to training and deployment) but from time to time we're also working on things like integrating marketing and sales tools, fighting fires, automating internal processes, and open source projects.You'll have a wide degree of freedom to advocate for which projects you think should be highest priority and will contribute to increasing engagement and success of enterprise customers. If you need a rigid list of tasks spelled out in a multi-month roadmap, this role probably won't be a good fit.The majority of our codebase is written in JavaScript, our machine learning and image processing pipeline is in Python. We run primarily on Firebase and GCS, with some machine learning infrastructure on AWS. We're increasingly using Docker (both internally and for customer facing products like our edge inference server). A lot of our code runs in the browser (including some Tensorflow JS) but we're also working on building APIs and client libraries in several languages.You certainly don't need to be experienced in all of these areas; but should be excited to learn new skill sets as you need them. We also hope you'll bring some new knowledge and experiences you can share to help level-up the rest of the team.Example ProjectsAdding video recording and analysis tools to the Roboflow SaaS application, so that Field Engineers can quickly and efficiently collect and understand customer data.Streamlining the setup of new devices or inspections in the Roboflow application.Adding a new workflow block to allow customers to send visual insights to Power BI or Tableau.Adding new capabilities for edge device management such as GPS coordinate visualization.\ud83d\udcc5 Within one week, you will\u2026Learn all about computer vision, our product, company, customers, and vision.Meet with a customer and learn about their use case.Ship something substantial to an end user\ud83d\udcc5 Within one month, you will\u2026Onboard in person with your manager (you\u2019ll come to our NY or SF Hub!)Build your first computer vision project with Roboflow (if you haven't already)Go on site with an enterprise customer\ud83d\udcc5 Within six months, you will\u2026Attend your first all company onsiteBe ramped up on other relevant parts of the Roboflow product.Who You'll Be Working WithOur team of ~50 attracts talent like executives that wanted to return to building, founders with a 100M+ exit, Roboflow users turned team members, open source contributors, a cyclist who biked across the United States, prolific high school hackers, a CTO from 100+ engineering organization, amongst many exceptional others.You will directly be working with our Enterprise Lead and a team of Full Stack Engineers.Where You'll WorkRoboflow is distributed across the US and Europe.

For over 80 years, the company has successfully sold the world-famous herbal liqueur, J\u00e4germeister, and links the great tradition of a family business with innovative marketing.  Today J\u00e4germeister is marketed in over 100 countries and is the largest selling premium liqueur brand in the world.\n\nMJSE is firmly rooted in Wolfenb\u00fcttel in the German region of Lower Saxony.  The company has produced its globally successful herbal liqueur based on a secret recipe of 56 different herbs, blossoms and roots at this site for over 80 years.  Today, around 900 employees worldwide work for the Wolfenb\u00fcttel-based family company. \n\nFor over 40 years, Mast-J\u00e4germeister US, Inc. (MJUS was formerly known as Sidney Frank Importing Co.) and MJSE have been working in a trusted partnership and together have successfully built J\u00e4germeister to be the top selling liqueur and an iconic brand in the United States market.\n\nSFIC was founded in 1972 by legendary brand builder, Sidney Frank. In 1974, MJSE appointed SFIC as its exclusive importer for the United States. Sidney Frank pursued new and creative ways to promote the brand, and through the introduction of ground breaking initiatives such as The J\u00e4gerettes, bar parties, the J\u00e4germeister Tap Machine and brand sponsored bands, the company fueled sales and turned the little known brand into the number one selling imported liqueur in the United States. \n\nIn 2015, SFIC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MJUS.  Based in White Plains, New York, the company staffs more than 180 full-time employees and has a network of distributors and brokers throughout the United States. MJUS prides itself on being creative and effective beverage alcohol brand stewards, and encourages a forward-thinking approach to quality brand building, while drawing inspiration from the company's proven success and rich heritage. \n",

Opto is not compensated by fund managers to offer funds, which enables an undiluted focus on quality. When Opto recommends an investment, it's with purpose. When they pass, it's with conviction. Clients can combine their best ideas with Opto\u2019s in a bespoke partnership tailored to their needs.\n\nOpto\u2019s platform automates admin processes across the entire private markets investment journey, saving advisors hours of time inputting client data, creating compelling proposals, completing subscription documents, managing capital calls, and delivering client communications.",

C\u2019est la mission propos\u00e9e qui m\u2019a attir\u00e9 en premier lieu (support pre-trade en salle de march\u00e9) , mais ce sont les valeurs humaines et l\u2019accompagnement dont fait preuve le cabinet qui m\u2019a fait rester. J\u2019ai toujours eu des missions g\u00e9niales chez Quanteam.

Quanteam est tr\u00e8s bien r\u00e9f\u00e9renc\u00e9 chez nos clients et le cabinet propose de belles missions, avec de beaux challenges techniques et fonctionnels.

J\u2019avais une tr\u00e8s belle proposition c\u00f4t\u00e9 \u00e9diteur, mais j\u2019ai rapidement senti un feeling humain et une sensation de bienveillance lors de mes premiers \u00e9changes avec Quanteam, qui ont fait la diff\u00e9rence et qui m\u2019ont convaincue de rejoindre le cabinet. La qualit\u00e9 et la diversit\u00e9 des missions propos\u00e9es dans le secteur Bancaire, domaine de pr\u00e9dilection du cabinet, \u00e9taient \u00e9galement un atout non n\u00e9gligeable pour moi. J\u2019ai d\u2019ailleurs pu r\u00e9aliser deux belles missions (direction de projets et de conseil) et j\u2019ai pu coacher des consultants en amont de leurs entretiens de missions. Deux ans apr\u00e8s, je ne regrette pas mon choix. Je retrouve cette proximit\u00e9 et cette volont\u00e9 de collaborer, au quotidien, notamment avec l\u2019\u00e9quipe commerciale mais \u00e9galement au sein des \u00e9quipes projets.Chacun peut trouver sa place et \u00e9voluerMarc, Chef de projet MOA chez Quanteam / co-directeur de la Practice Operations &amp; FinanceJe suis consultant depuis plus de 20 ans, au sein de diff\u00e9rentes Banques et Assurances. J\u2019ai rejoint le bureau parisien de Quanteam il y a 7 ans car j\u2019ai appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 les valeurs humaines lors des premi\u00e8res rencontres, valeurs que je partage au quotidien. La direction reste \u00e9galement tr\u00e8s accessible et transparente dans ses \u00e9changes avec les collaborateurs du cabinet, comme ce fut le cas lors de la p\u00e9riode COVID. Ce qui est d\u2019autant plus appr\u00e9ciable que ce n\u2019a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 le cas partout. Enfin, les missions propos\u00e9es diversifi\u00e9es et vari\u00e9es permettent \u00e0 chacun et chacune de s\u2019enrichir professionnellement et personnellement.La libert\u00e9 de choisir ses missions est tr\u00e8s appr\u00e9ciableMathieu, Consultant Manager \u2013 Practice Transformation et OrganisationJ\u2019ai rejoint Quanteam en 2019, apr\u00e8s plusieurs exp\u00e9riences dans le conseil, en tant qu\u2019Analyste Equity Derivatives, puis comme Chef de Projets IT. J\u2019occupe aujourd\u2019hui un r\u00f4le de Scrum Master / BA au sein d\u2019une \u00e9quipe anti-fraude. Ce qui me pla\u00eet chez Quanteam, c\u2019est la richesse et la diversit\u00e9 des missions propos\u00e9es, et la forte implantation du cabinet sur les secteurs bancaires et financiers. Le cabinet \u00e9coute les souhaits de ses consultants et leurs donne le choix des missions, ce qui n\u2019est pas le cas partout. En termes d\u2019\u00e9volution, j\u2019ai souhait\u00e9 int\u00e9grer la Practice Transformation et Organisation afin d\u2019acqu\u00e9rir de nouvelles comp\u00e9tences, gr\u00e2ce aux experts qui la compose. J\u2019ai r\u00e9alis\u00e9 plusieurs formations certifiantes, ce qui me donne vraiment l\u2019impression que le cabinet investi sur moi.La satisfaction d\u2019\u00eatre reconnu pour son travail et d\u2019\u00e9voluer dans une bonne ambianceGeoffroy, Consultant Expert \u2013 Practice Finance QuantitativeApr\u00e8s des \u00e9tudes en Ing\u00e9nierie et un Master de Recherche en Nanotechnologie, j\u2019ai travaill\u00e9 dans les secteurs de l\u2019Energie et du Retail, au sein de cabinets de conseil / ESN du Big Four.

    "descriptionHtml": "<strong>Overview<br><br></strong><strong>About Bayview Asset Management, LLC<br><br></strong>Bayview Asset Management, LLC (\u201cBayview\u201d), initially founded in 1993, is an investment management firm focused on investments in mortgage and consumer credit, including whole loans, asset backed securities, mortgage servicing rights, and other credit-related assets.<br><br>With over 1,550 employees, our corporate headquarters is uniquely situated in the beautiful community of Coral Gables, Florida, located near the shores of Biscayne Bay and minutes from Miami Beach. The firm has additional asset management offices in New York, London, and Geneva, and loan servicing and origination affiliates in seven U.S. states and Milan, Italy. As of February 2025, Bayview managed approximately $20 billion in assets under management.<br><br><strong>About MSR Portfolio Management<br><br></strong>The Bayview Mortgage Servicing Rights (\u201cMSR\u201d) Fund along with its wholly owned subsidiary Lakeview Loan Servicing (\u201cLakeview\u201d) is the largest of Bayview\u2019s funds. Lakeview is the top servicer of agency MSRs in the United States, and actively sources new MSRs across its origination platform and bulk and co-issue MSR businesses.<br><br>MSRs are essentially interest-only (IO) cash flow strips on underlying pools of mortgages. Like IOs on any other callable bond, MSRs are susceptible to prepayment and credit risk. Yet it is so much more than that - the MSR owner is entitled to many different income and expense cash flows. On a single MSR asset, we model and monitor over 60 types of cash flows.<br><br><strong>Essential Responsibilities &amp; Duties<br><br></strong>Your primary role (80%) will be model developer. Model development is crucial in our MSR portfolio management strategy as the model drives all investment and portfolio management decisions. Responsibilities include, but are not limited to:<br><br><ul><li> Implement latest business strategies and model enhancements into production C++ model.</li><li> Restructure and remodel the legacy code infrastructure (C++). This will result in a more maintainable infrastructure which can adapt better to the ongoing business requirements and will significantly speed up the model development process.</li><li> Optimize the existing software tools and create new ones to speed up the model validation and running processes, so the end users can get the model result reports faster and easier.</li><li> Help in moving the on-premises environment onto the cloud, which involves data, analysis tools, and model running platform (e.g. HPC on cloud).</li><li> Convert the existing standalone tools (using Excel or Windows Form as the UI) to web-based applications, so that they will be more portable, and easier to be run on multiple computers instead of a single machine.<br><br></li></ul>Your secondary role (20%) is a financial analyst who assists us in investment decision-making. We envision you to be more than a programmer and be someone who actively take part in the operation of the fund.

    "descriptionText": "OverviewAbout Bayview Asset Management, LLCBayview Asset Management, LLC (\u201cBayview\u201d), initially founded in 1993, is an investment management firm focused on investments in mortgage and consumer credit, including whole loans, asset backed securities, mortgage servicing rights, and other credit-related assets.With over 1,550 employees, our corporate headquarters is uniquely situated in the beautiful community of Coral Gables, Florida, located near the shores of Biscayne Bay and minutes from Miami Beach. The firm has additional asset management offices in New York, London, and Geneva, and loan servicing and origination affiliates in seven U.S. states and Milan, Italy. As of February 2025, Bayview managed approximately $20 billion in assets under management.About MSR Portfolio ManagementThe Bayview Mortgage Servicing Rights (\u201cMSR\u201d) Fund along with its wholly owned subsidiary Lakeview Loan Servicing (\u201cLakeview\u201d) is the largest of Bayview\u2019s funds. Lakeview is the top servicer of agency MSRs in the United States, and actively sources new MSRs across its origination platform and bulk and co-issue MSR businesses.MSRs are essentially interest-only (IO) cash flow strips on underlying pools of mortgages. Like IOs on any other callable bond, MSRs are susceptible to prepayment and credit risk. Yet it is so much more than that - the MSR owner is entitled to many different income and expense cash flows. On a single MSR asset, we model and monitor over 60 types of cash flows.Essential Responsibilities &amp; DutiesYour primary role (80%) will be model developer. Model development is crucial in our MSR portfolio management strategy as the model drives all investment and portfolio management decisions. Responsibilities include, but are not limited to: Implement latest business strategies and model enhancements into production C++ model. Restructure and remodel the legacy code infrastructure (C++). This will result in a more maintainable infrastructure which can adapt better to the ongoing business requirements and will significantly speed up the model development process. Optimize the existing software tools and create new ones to speed up the model validation and running processes, so the end users can get the model result reports faster and easier. Help in moving the on-premises environment onto the cloud, which involves data, analysis tools, and model running platform (e.g. HPC on cloud). Convert the existing standalone tools (using Excel or Windows Form as the UI) to web-based applications, so that they will be more portable, and easier to be run on multiple computers instead of a single machine.Your secondary role (20%) is a financial analyst who assists us in investment decision-making. We envision you to be more than a programmer and be someone who actively take part in the operation of the fund. Tasks include but are not limited to the following: Perform risk analysis of our existing portfolio Mark-to-market and go-forward IRR evaluationYour work will be impactful from the start and will only expand in the future according to your strengths and aspirations. We are a small yet efficient team where we expect to rely on you and your expertise, as we do with all members of our team.Education &amp; Experience Minimum of 2+ years of direct work experience Candidates typically possess an undergraduate degree in a hard science, math, computer science, engineering or finance.

    "descriptionHtml": "<strong>Overview<br><br></strong><strong>About Bayview Asset Management, LLC<br><br></strong>Bayview Asset Management, LLC (\u201cBayview\u201d), initially founded in 1993, is an investment management firm focused on investments in mortgage and consumer credit, including whole loans, asset backed securities, mortgage servicing rights, and other credit-related assets.<br><br>With over 1,550 employees, our corporate headquarters is uniquely situated in the beautiful community of Coral Gables, Florida, located near the shores of Biscayne Bay and minutes from Miami Beach. The firm has additional asset management offices in New York, London, and Geneva, and loan servicing and origination affiliates in seven U.S. states and Milan, Italy. As of February 2025, Bayview managed approximately $20 billion in assets under management.<br><br><strong>About MSR Portfolio Management<br><br></strong>The Bayview Mortgage Servicing Rights (\u201cMSR\u201d) Fund along with its wholly owned subsidiary Lakeview Loan Servicing (\u201cLakeview\u201d) is the largest of Bayview\u2019s funds. Lakeview is the top servicer of agency MSRs in the United States, and actively sources new MSRs across its origination platform and bulk and co-issue MSR businesses.<br><br>MSRs are essentially interest-only (IO) cash flow strips on underlying pools of mortgages. Like IOs on any other callable bond, MSRs are susceptible to prepayment and credit risk. Yet it is so much more than that - the MSR owner is entitled to many different income and expense cash flows. On a single MSR asset, we model and monitor over 60 types of cash flows.<br><br><strong>Essential Responsibilities &amp; Duties<br><br></strong>Your primary role (80%) will be model developer. Model development is crucial in our MSR portfolio management strategy as the model drives all investment and portfolio management decisions.

    "descriptionText": "OverviewAbout Bayview Asset Management, LLCBayview Asset Management, LLC (\u201cBayview\u201d), initially founded in 1993, is an investment management firm focused on investments in mortgage and consumer credit, including whole loans, asset backed securities, mortgage servicing rights, and other credit-related assets.With over 1,550 employees, our corporate headquarters is uniquely situated in the beautiful community of Coral Gables, Florida, located near the shores of Biscayne Bay and minutes from Miami Beach. The firm has additional asset management offices in New York, London, and Geneva, and loan servicing and origination affiliates in seven U.S. states and Milan, Italy. As of February 2025, Bayview managed approximately $20 billion in assets under management.About MSR Portfolio ManagementThe Bayview Mortgage Servicing Rights (\u201cMSR\u201d) Fund along with its wholly owned subsidiary Lakeview Loan Servicing (\u201cLakeview\u201d) is the largest of Bayview\u2019s funds. Lakeview is the top servicer of agency MSRs in the United States, and actively sources new MSRs across its origination platform and bulk and co-issue MSR businesses.MSRs are essentially interest-only (IO) cash flow strips on underlying pools of mortgages. Like IOs on any other callable bond, MSRs are susceptible to prepayment and credit risk. Yet it is so much more than that - the MSR owner is entitled to many different income and expense cash flows. On a single MSR asset, we model and monitor over 60 types of cash flows.Essential Responsibilities &amp; DutiesYour primary role (80%) will be model developer.

As a Senior Developer Advocate on our Developer Experience team, you'll combine your software development expertise with your passion for building developer communities. This role offers a unique opportunity to influence how the next generation of AI applications are built, while working alongside the creators and innovators in this rapidly evolving space.<br><br>Our ideal candidate is someone who lives and breathes code, has a track record of building production generative AI applications, and brings fresh perspectives to complex technical challenges. You understand the transformative potential of foundation models and autonomous agents, and you're excited to help developers harness these technologies effectively.<br><br>Key job responsibilities<br><br>In this role, you'll drive technical initiatives that showcase the full potential of generative AI on AWS, from proof-of-concepts to production-ready solutions. You'll work with emerging standards and frameworks like Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent2Agent (A2A) communication protocols, and Strands Agents to shape the future of AI application development. Your days might involve creating compelling technical demonstrations of autonomous agents using these technologies, building production-ready implementations with foundation models, or sharing deep technical insights through conference talks and live coding sessions. Through direct collaboration with engineering teams, you'll help shape both AWS AI services and the broader open-source AI ecosystem.<br><br>You'll be at the forefront of developing and sharing best practices for integrating advanced AI capabilities into robust, scalable applications, with a particular focus on autonomous and agentic systems. Through your hands-on development work and community engagement, you'll identify developer pain points, work cross-functionally to influence product roadmaps, and contribute to open source projects. Your technical content, whether it's code samples, architecture patterns, or implementation guides, will help developers build better AI applications.<br><br>A key aspect of this role is the opportunity to work with a broad range of partners. You'll collaborate with industry leaders like Anthropic, Meta, and others, showcasing how their technologies integrate with AWS services to create onnovative AI solutions. This exposure will allow you to stay at the leading edge of AI development across the industry and bring diverse perspectives to the developer community.<br><br>This role will require up to 25% travel (mostly within mainland USA).<br><br><strong>About The Team<br><br></strong>We're a group of builders and innovators who are passionate about defining the future of software development.
