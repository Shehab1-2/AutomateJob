  "descriptionHtml": "<strong>Who We Are<br><br></strong>Our mission is to make the world programmable. Sight is one of the key ways we understand the world, and soon this will be true for the software we use, too.<br><br>At Roboflow, we’re building the tools, community, and resources needed to make the world programmable with artificial intelligence. Roboflow simplifies building and using computer vision models. Today, over 1M developers, including those from half the Fortune 100, use Roboflow’s machine learning open source and hosted tools. That includes counting cells to accelerate cancer research, improving construction site safety, digitizing floor plans, preserving coral reef populations, guiding drone flight, and much more.<br><br>Our team is small relative to our impact, and we believe our user success is our success (not the inverse). A team member summarized: “Roboflow is a company full of giant brains and tiny egos.” We find software has a multiplier effect on all roles (not only product and engineering), so Roboflow employs developers across the company in design, sales, customer support, marketing, and beyond.<br><br>We’re supported by great customers and investors, having raised over $63 million from Google Ventures (check out our Series B announcement here!), Y Combinator, Craft Ventures, Sam Altman, Lachy Groom, amongst other leading software investors.<br><br><strong>What We're Looking For<br><br></strong>Primarily, you like to make great things with passionate colleagues. You are someone that likes to own outcomes, not only inputs. You’re motivated by having responsibility and accountability. You’re eager to ‘do the work,’ big and small.<br><br>We’re hiring an enterprise focused engineer to help make Roboflow the best possible platform for enterprise computer vision, and expand partnerships with our enterprise customers. You should have strong communication skills, and a track record of success building computer vision applications and a desire to drive innovation in an enterprise setting.<br><br>You’re curious and learning about new technologies, perhaps an early tinkerer with ChatGPT and AI products. You show more than you tell.<br><br>You’re motivated by the question, “How can I improve this?” and have a track record of doing so, even in ways adjacent to your role. Much of our current team is made up of former founders and thrive in the level of autonomy at Roboflow. Maybe you had a side hustle in high school or college.<br><br>Many Roboflowers have used our tools before joining. One of the best ways to stand out amongst other applicants is to write about something you have built with Roboflow or contribute to one of our open source projects.<br><br><strong>What You'll Do<br><br></strong>As a member of the Enterprise team, you'll be tasked with creating new features and making improvements anywhere in the Roboflow product. We're looking for technical generalists that aren’t afraid to dive into a new stack or toolchain if the need arises (but JavaScript and Node.js make up the brunt of the existing codebase). You will also help support and make improvements to our enterprise Jetson inference pipeline, so a solid foundation in Linux is highly desirable.<br><br>The Enterprise team forms close relationships with Enterprise customers to deeply understand their needs and advance their usage and success with Roboflow. You should expect to frequently be on-site with customers, doing factory tours, and building features needed to make prospective and current customers successful in Computer Vision with Roboflow.<br><br>As a member of the Enterprise team, you will also partner closely with the Field Engineering team. Not only to understand and expand partnerships with customers, but to identify opportunities to make the Field Engineers more efficient in collecting visual data and delivering insights to customers based on that data.<br><br>Most of the things we work on are parts of the core product (which is an end-to-end pipeline for building computer vision projects spanning from image ingestion to annotation to training and deployment) but from time to time we're also working on things like integrating marketing and sales tools, fighting fires, automating internal processes, and open source projects.<br><br>You'll have a wide degree of freedom to advocate for which projects you think should be highest priority and will contribute to increasing engagement and success of enterprise customers. If you need a rigid list of tasks spelled out in a multi-month roadmap, this role probably won't be a good fit.<br><br>The majority of our codebase is written in JavaScript, our machine learning and image processing pipeline is in Python. We run primarily on Firebase and GCS, with some machine learning infrastructure on AWS. We're increasingly using Docker (both internally and for customer facing products like our edge inference server). A lot of our code runs in the browser (including some Tensorflow JS) but we're also working on building APIs and client libraries in several languages.<br><br>You certainly don't need to be experienced in all of these areas; but should be excited to learn new skill sets as you need them. We also hope you'll bring some new knowledge and experiences you can share to help level-up the rest of the team.<br><br><strong>Example Projects<br><br></strong><ul><li>Adding video recording and analysis tools to the Roboflow SaaS application, so that Field Engineers can quickly and efficiently collect and understand customer data.</li><li>Streamlining the setup of new devices or inspections in the Roboflow application.</li><li>Adding a new workflow block to allow customers to send visual insights to Power BI or Tableau.</li><li>Adding new capabilities for edge device management such as GPS coordinate visualization.<br><br></li></ul>📅 <strong>Within one week, you will…<br><br></strong><ul><li>Learn all about computer vision, our product, company, customers, and vision.</li><li>Meet with a customer and learn about their use case.</li><li>Ship something substantial to an end user<br><br></li></ul>📅 <strong>Within one month, you will…<br><br></strong><ul><li>Onboard in person with your manager (you’ll come to our NY or SF Hub!)</li><li>Build your first computer vision project with Roboflow (if you haven't already)</li><li>Go on site with an enterprise customer<br><br></li></ul><strong>📅 Within six months, you will…<br><br></strong><ul><li>Attend your first all company onsite</li><li>Be ramped up on other relevant parts of the Roboflow product.<br><br></li></ul><strong>Who You'll Be Working With<br><br></strong>Our team of ~50 attracts talent like executives that wanted to return to building, founders with a 100M+ exit, Roboflow users turned team members, open source contributors, a cyclist who biked across the United States, prolific high school hackers, a CTO from 100+ engineering organization, amongst many exceptional others.<br><br>You will directly be working with our Enterprise Lead and a team of Full Stack Engineers.<br><br><strong>Where You'll Work<br><br></strong>Roboflow is distributed across the US and Europe. We currently have Hubs in New York City and San Francisco (and plan to open more as we grow density in new cities). We provide opportunities (like team onsites in different cities) and resources (like a $4000/yr travel stipend) to work in person with other team members as much as you'd like, while also supporting remote team members. You can work from one of our Hubs (we offer a relocation bonus), work from home, work at co-working spaces, etc. We want you to work where you work best!<br><br><strong>When You'll Work<br><br></strong>Roboflow primarily operates during the daytime hours in the US and there are some synchronous meetings you’ll be expected to attend each week. Apart from that, we have a flexible schedule that allows you to work collaboratively with other team members and asynchronously when needed.<br><br>As a member of the Enterprise team, this role requires travel. In addition to two required team meetups, you will travel to be on site with customers 1-2 times per quarter.<br><br><strong>What You'll Receive<br><br></strong>To determine your salary, we use a number of market and data-driven salary sources. We review all salaries every six months to ensure we stay in line with the market.<br><br>💰 The target compensation for this role is $165,000-$195,000 base, commensurate with experience.<br><br>📈 In addition to our cash compensation, we offer generous perks and benefits. Below are some of the highlights:<br><br><ul><li>$4000/yr Travel Stipend to travel anywhere anytime to work alongside other Roboflowers</li><li>$350/mo Productivity stipend to spend on things that make your work environment more productive, like high-speed internet at home or a co-working space</li><li>Cover up to 100% of your health insurance costs for you and your partner or family</li><li>Equity in the company so we are all invested in the future of computer vision<br><br></li></ul><strong>Interview Process (7+ hours)<br><br></strong>Below is the interview process you can expect for this role.

For over 80 years, the company has successfully sold the world-famous herbal liqueur, Jägermeister, and links the great tradition of a family business with innovative marketing.  Today Jägermeister is marketed in over 100 countries and is the largest selling premium liqueur brand in the world.\n\nMJSE is firmly rooted in Wolfenbüttel in the German region of Lower Saxony.  The company has produced its globally successful herbal liqueur based on a secret recipe of 56 different herbs, blossoms and roots at this site for over 80 years.  Today, around 900 employees worldwide work for the Wolfenbüttel-based family company. \n\nFor over 40 years, Mast-Jägermeister US, Inc. (MJUS was formerly known as Sidney Frank Importing Co.) and MJSE have been working in a trusted partnership and together have successfully built Jägermeister to be the top selling liqueur and an iconic brand in the United States market.\n\nSFIC was founded in 1972 by legendary brand builder, Sidney Frank. In 1974, MJSE appointed SFIC as its exclusive importer for the United States. Sidney Frank pursued new and creative ways to promote the brand, and through the introduction of ground breaking initiatives such as The Jägerettes, bar parties, the Jägermeister Tap Machine and brand sponsored bands, the company fueled sales and turned the little known brand into the number one selling imported liqueur in the United States. \n\nIn 2015, SFIC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MJUS.  Based in White Plains, New York, the company staffs more than 180 full-time employees and has a network of distributors and brokers throughout the United States. MJUS prides itself on being creative and effective beverage alcohol brand stewards, and encourages a forward-thinking approach to quality brand building, while drawing inspiration from the company's proven success and rich heritage. \n",

  "descriptionHtml": "<strong>Overview<br><br></strong><strong>About Bayview Asset Management, LLC<br><br></strong>Bayview Asset Management, LLC (“Bayview”), initially founded in 1993, is an investment management firm focused on investments in mortgage and consumer credit, including whole loans, asset backed securities, mortgage servicing rights, and other credit-related assets.<br><br>With over 1,550 employees, our corporate headquarters is uniquely situated in the beautiful community of Coral Gables, Florida, located near the shores of Biscayne Bay and minutes from Miami Beach. The firm has additional asset management offices in New York, London, and Geneva, and loan servicing and origination affiliates in seven U.S. states and Milan, Italy. As of February 2025, Bayview managed approximately $20 billion in assets under management.<br><br><strong>About MSR Portfolio Management<br><br></strong>The Bayview Mortgage Servicing Rights (“MSR”) Fund along with its wholly owned subsidiary Lakeview Loan Servicing (“Lakeview”) is the largest of Bayview’s funds. Lakeview is the top servicer of agency MSRs in the United States, and actively sources new MSRs across its origination platform and bulk and co-issue MSR businesses.<br><br>MSRs are essentially interest-only (IO) cash flow strips on underlying pools of mortgages. Like IOs on any other callable bond, MSRs are susceptible to prepayment and credit risk. Yet it is so much more than that - the MSR owner is entitled to many different income and expense cash flows. On a single MSR asset, we model and monitor over 60 types of cash flows.<br><br><strong>Essential Responsibilities &amp; Duties<br><br></strong>Your primary role (80%) will be model developer. Model development is crucial in our MSR portfolio management strategy as the model drives all investment and portfolio management decisions. Responsibilities include, but are not limited to:<br><br><ul><li> Implement latest business strategies and model enhancements into production C++ model.</li><li> Restructure and remodel the legacy code infrastructure (C++). This will result in a more maintainable infrastructure which can adapt better to the ongoing business requirements and will significantly speed up the model development process.</li><li> Optimize the existing software tools and create new ones to speed up the model validation and running processes, so the end users can get the model result reports faster and easier.</li><li> Help in moving the on-premises environment onto the cloud, which involves data, analysis tools, and model running platform (e.g. HPC on cloud).</li><li> Convert the existing standalone tools (using Excel or Windows Form as the UI) to web-based applications, so that they will be more portable, and easier to be run on multiple computers instead of a single machine.<br><br></li></ul>Your secondary role (20%) is a financial analyst who assists us in investment decision-making. We envision you to be more than a programmer and be someone who actively take part in the operation of the fund. Tasks include but are not limited to the following:<br><br><ul><li> Perform risk analysis of our existing portfolio</li><li> Mark-to-market and go-forward IRR evaluation<br><br></li></ul>Your work will be impactful from the start and will only expand in the future according to your strengths and aspirations. We are a small yet efficient team where we expect to rely on you and your expertise, as we do with all members of our team.<br><br><strong>Education &amp; Experience<br><br></strong><ul><li> Minimum of 2+ years of direct work experience</li><li> Candidates typically possess an undergraduate degree in a hard science, math, computer science, engineering or finance.

  "descriptionText": "OverviewAbout Bayview Asset Management, LLCBayview Asset Management, LLC (“Bayview”), initially founded in 1993, is an investment management firm focused on investments in mortgage and consumer credit, including whole loans, asset backed securities, mortgage servicing rights, and other credit-related assets.With over 1,550 employees, our corporate headquarters is uniquely situated in the beautiful community of Coral Gables, Florida, located near the shores of Biscayne Bay and minutes from Miami Beach. The firm has additional asset management offices in New York, London, and Geneva, and loan servicing and origination affiliates in seven U.S. states and Milan, Italy. As of February 2025, Bayview managed approximately $20 billion in assets under management.About MSR Portfolio ManagementThe Bayview Mortgage Servicing Rights (“MSR”) Fund along with its wholly owned subsidiary Lakeview Loan Servicing (“Lakeview”) is the largest of Bayview’s funds. Lakeview is the top servicer of agency MSRs in the United States, and actively sources new MSRs across its origination platform and bulk and co-issue MSR businesses.MSRs are essentially interest-only (IO) cash flow strips on underlying pools of mortgages. Like IOs on any other callable bond, MSRs are susceptible to prepayment and credit risk. Yet it is so much more than that - the MSR owner is entitled to many different income and expense cash flows. On a single MSR asset, we model and monitor over 60 types of cash flows.Essential Responsibilities &amp; DutiesYour primary role (80%) will be model developer. Model development is crucial in our MSR portfolio management strategy as the model drives all investment and portfolio management decisions. Responsibilities include, but are not limited to: Implement latest business strategies and model enhancements into production C++ model. Restructure and remodel the legacy code infrastructure (C++). This will result in a more maintainable infrastructure which can adapt better to the ongoing business requirements and will significantly speed up the model development process. Optimize the existing software tools and create new ones to speed up the model validation and running processes, so the end users can get the model result reports faster and easier. Help in moving the on-premises environment onto the cloud, which involves data, analysis tools, and model running platform (e.g. HPC on cloud). Convert the existing standalone tools (using Excel or Windows Form as the UI) to web-based applications, so that they will be more portable, and easier to be run on multiple computers instead of a single machine.Your secondary role (20%) is a financial analyst who assists us in investment decision-making. We envision you to be more than a programmer and be someone who actively take part in the operation of the fund. Tasks include but are not limited to the following: Perform risk analysis of our existing portfolio Mark-to-market and go-forward IRR evaluationYour work will be impactful from the start and will only expand in the future according to your strengths and aspirations. We are a small yet efficient team where we expect to rely on you and your expertise, as we do with all members of our team.Education &amp; Experience Minimum of 2+ years of direct work experience Candidates typically possess an undergraduate degree in a hard science, math, computer science, engineering or finance.

  "descriptionHtml": "<strong>Overview<br><br></strong><strong>About Bayview Asset Management, LLC<br><br></strong>Bayview Asset Management, LLC (“Bayview”), initially founded in 1993, is an investment management firm focused on investments in mortgage and consumer credit, including whole loans, asset backed securities, mortgage servicing rights, and other credit-related assets.<br><br>With over 1,550 employees, our corporate headquarters is uniquely situated in the beautiful community of Coral Gables, Florida, located near the shores of Biscayne Bay and minutes from Miami Beach. The firm has additional asset management offices in New York, London, and Geneva, and loan servicing and origination affiliates in seven U.S. states and Milan, Italy. As of February 2025, Bayview managed approximately $20 billion in assets under management.<br><br><strong>About MSR Portfolio Management<br><br></strong>The Bayview Mortgage Servicing Rights (“MSR”) Fund along with its wholly owned subsidiary Lakeview Loan Servicing (“Lakeview”) is the largest of Bayview’s funds. Lakeview is the top servicer of agency MSRs in the United States, and actively sources new MSRs across its origination platform and bulk and co-issue MSR businesses.<br><br>MSRs are essentially interest-only (IO) cash flow strips on underlying pools of mortgages. Like IOs on any other callable bond, MSRs are susceptible to prepayment and credit risk. Yet it is so much more than that - the MSR owner is entitled to many different income and expense cash flows. On a single MSR asset, we model and monitor over 60 types of cash flows.<br><br><strong>Essential Responsibilities &amp; Duties<br><br></strong>Your primary role (80%) will be model developer. Model development is crucial in our MSR portfolio management strategy as the model drives all investment and portfolio management decisions. Responsibilities include, but are not limited to:<br><br><ul><li> Implement latest business strategies and model enhancements into production C++ model.</li><li> Restructure and remodel the legacy code infrastructure (C++). This will result in a more maintainable infrastructure which can adapt better to the ongoing business requirements and will significantly speed up the model development process.</li><li> Optimize the existing software tools and create new ones to speed up the model validation and running processes, so the end users can get the model result reports faster and easier.</li><li> Help in moving the on-premises environment onto the cloud, which involves data, analysis tools, and model running platform (e.g. HPC on cloud).</li><li> Convert the existing standalone tools (using Excel or Windows Form as the UI) to web-based applications, so that they will be more portable, and easier to be run on multiple computers instead of a single machine.<br><br></li></ul>Your secondary role (20%) is a financial analyst who assists us in investment decision-making. We envision you to be more than a programmer and be someone who actively take part in the operation of the fund. Tasks include but are not limited to the following:<br><br><ul><li> Perform risk analysis of our existing portfolio</li><li> Mark-to-market and go-forward IRR evaluation<br><br></li></ul>Your work will be impactful from the start and will only expand in the future according to your strengths and aspirations. We are a small yet efficient team where we expect to rely on you and your expertise, as we do with all members of our team.<br><br><strong>Education &amp; Experience<br><br></strong><ul><li> Minimum of 2+ years of direct work experience</li><li> Candidates typically possess an undergraduate degree in a hard science, math, computer science, engineering or finance. A Master’s degree is a plus.</li><li> Basic knowledge in Fixed Income</li><li> Strong scientific programming skills, C++ highly preferred</li><li> Basic proficiency in SQL preferred</li><li> Strong communication skills</li><li> Advanced proficiency in Excel and VBA</li><li> Methodical problem-solving ability with limited direction</li><li> Attention to detail and analytical mindset<br><br></li></ul><strong>Location &amp; Compensation<br><br></strong><ul><li> This role can be based in either Bayview’s Coral Gables, FL or NYC offices. We have existing team members in this location.</li><li> Base compensation is expected to be $100,000-125,000 with the opportunity for incentive compensation including bonus compensation.<br><br></li></ul><strong>Physical Demands and Work Environment<br><br></strong>The physical demands described here are representative of those that must be met by an employee to successfully perform the essential functions of this job. Reasonable accommodations may be made to enable individuals with disabilities to perform the essential functions.<br><br>While performing the duties of this job, the employee is regularly required to sit and use hands to handle, touch or feel objects, tools, or controls. The employee frequently is required to talk and hear. The noise level in the work environment is usually moderate. The employee is occasionally required to stand; walk; reach with hands and arms. The employee is rarely required to stoop, kneel, crouch, or crawl. The employee must regularly lift and/or move up to 10 pounds. Specific vision abilities required by this job include close vision, color vision, and the ability to adjust focus.<br><br><strong>EEOC<br><br></strong>Bayview is an Equal Employment Opportunity employer.

  "descriptionText": "OverviewAbout Bayview Asset Management, LLCBayview Asset Management, LLC (“Bayview”), initially founded in 1993, is an investment management firm focused on investments in mortgage and consumer credit, including whole loans, asset backed securities, mortgage servicing rights, and other credit-related assets.With over 1,550 employees, our corporate headquarters is uniquely situated in the beautiful community of Coral Gables, Florida, located near the shores of Biscayne Bay and minutes from Miami Beach. The firm has additional asset management offices in New York, London, and Geneva, and loan servicing and origination affiliates in seven U.S. states and Milan, Italy. As of February 2025, Bayview managed approximately $20 billion in assets under management.About MSR Portfolio ManagementThe Bayview Mortgage Servicing Rights (“MSR”) Fund along with its wholly owned subsidiary Lakeview Loan Servicing (“Lakeview”) is the largest of Bayview’s funds. Lakeview is the top servicer of agency MSRs in the United States, and actively sources new MSRs across its origination platform and bulk and co-issue MSR businesses.MSRs are essentially interest-only (IO) cash flow strips on underlying pools of mortgages. Like IOs on any other callable bond, MSRs are susceptible to prepayment and credit risk. Yet it is so much more than that - the MSR owner is entitled to many different income and expense cash flows. On a single MSR asset, we model and monitor over 60 types of cash flows.Essential Responsibilities &amp; DutiesYour primary role (80%) will be model developer. Model development is crucial in our MSR portfolio management strategy as the model drives all investment and portfolio management decisions. Responsibilities include, but are not limited to: Implement latest business strategies and model enhancements into production C++ model. Restructure and remodel the legacy code infrastructure (C++). This will result in a more maintainable infrastructure which can adapt better to the ongoing business requirements and will significantly speed up the model development process. Optimize the existing software tools and create new ones to speed up the model validation and running processes, so the end users can get the model result reports faster and easier. Help in moving the on-premises environment onto the cloud, which involves data, analysis tools, and model running platform (e.g. HPC on cloud). Convert the existing standalone tools (using Excel or Windows Form as the UI) to web-based applications, so that they will be more portable, and easier to be run on multiple computers instead of a single machine.Your secondary role (20%) is a financial analyst who assists us in investment decision-making. We envision you to be more than a programmer and be someone who actively take part in the operation of the fund. Tasks include but are not limited to the following: Perform risk analysis of our existing portfolio Mark-to-market and go-forward IRR evaluationYour work will be impactful from the start and will only expand in the future according to your strengths and aspirations.

  "descriptionText": "AboutA World-Changing CompanyPalantir builds the world’s leading software for data-driven decisions and operations. By bringing the right data to the people who need it, our platforms empower our partners to develop lifesaving drugs, forecast supply chain disruptions, locate missing children, and more.What We're AboutAt its core, this role is about uncovering dots and—without knowing the shape they form—figuring out how to connect them. Our customers come to us with a hunch that the only way to protect their troops, manufacture high-quality products, structure effective healthcare policies, or deliver aid to refugees safely is to make better use of their data. Deployment Strategists are responsible for turning that hunch into reality.If you believe in the transformational power of data and technology and in your own ability to bring that power to bear against complex problems, we want to meet you.What We DoAs a Deployment Strategist, you'll work as part of a driven and creative team of Engineers, Product Designers, and other Deployment Strategists to deploy software against the most challenging problems our world faces. Your mission is to synthesize disconnected streams of thought into a cohesive understanding of what the most important problem is, what the data means, what the product needs, what users are motivated by, and where the impact could be.Deployment Strategists are do-ers who immerse themselves in our customers' most intricate workflows, partner with customer teams and explore the data, and dive into the product landscape to enable us to scale. A select number of Deployments Strategists may also be deployed to Palantir internal teams and problems. In this role, the problems you'll tackle will require a curious and analytical mindset, a sharp intuition for product, and a strong degree of user empathy to ultimately empower our customers to make better decisions.No two days are the same, but as a Deployment Strategist you can expect to:  Go onsite and meet with customer analysts to understand the critical questions they need to answer and locate their biggest pain points. Identify relevant datasets through deep engagement with customer problems and workflows, and work with Forward Deployed Engineers to integrate the data into a stable and extensible pipeline. Work with the customer to build bespoke workflows for new user groups. Lead training sessions to ensure that the product is meeting user needs, and to ensure it is being used widely enough to have concrete impact on our partners' operations. Present the results of our work and proposals for future work to audiences ranging from analysts to C-suite executives. Embed with our Software Engineering and Product Design teams to incorporate what you saw in the field into cross-Palantir product offerings. Build and deliver demos to new and existing customers. Scope out potential engagements in new industries and in increasingly expanding locations around the world. What We Value  We value team members who aren’t satisfied with surface-level answers. We value the desire to dive into the details of the data because that’s the core of our work. And we value low ego because the outcome matters more than who gets the credit. Extraordinary ability to take on open-ended problems in unstructured environments. Adaptive and introspective; willing to learn, teach, lead and follow. Experience with programming, scripting or statistical packages (e.g. Python, R, Matlab, SQL) is a plus. What We Require  Active US Security clearance or eligibility and willingness to obtain a US Security clearance. Ability to travel up to 75% required. Varies by location and team. SalaryThe estimated salary range for this position is estimated to be $110,000 - $170,000/year. Total compensation for this position may also include Restricted Stock units, sign-on bonus and other potential future incentives. Further note that total compensation for this position will be determined by each individual’s relevant qualifications, work experience, skills, and other factors.
