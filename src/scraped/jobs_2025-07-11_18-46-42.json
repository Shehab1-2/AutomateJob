    "companyDescription": "The D. E. Shaw group is trusted by investors across the world to manage their assets by seeking the optimal balance of risk and reward. While we\u2019re known as a pioneer in quantitative investing, we also have considerable expertise in areas that involve fundamental analysis or portfolio manager discretion. We use a combination of quantitative and qualitative tools to uncover independent, hard-to-find sources of return across global public and private markets.\n\nFounded in 1988 over a small bookstore in downtown New York City, the D. E. Shaw group began with six employees and $28 million in capital and quickly became a pioneer in computational finance. In the early days of exposed pipes and extension cords, tripping on a cable could take out our whole trading system. Today, the firm has more than 2,500 people around the globe and an institutional-grade (and trip-proof) infrastructure, but we still value creativity, entrepreneurship, and the spirit of discovery.\n\nIf you\u2019re an intellectually adventurous person who loves to collaborate on challenging and rewarding projects, we encourage you to apply.

    "companyDescription": "Mast-J\u00e4germeister SE of Germany (MJSE) is a leading premium spirits maker in the world.  For over 80 years, the company has successfully sold the world-famous herbal liqueur, J\u00e4germeister, and links the great tradition of a family business with innovative marketing.  Today J\u00e4germeister is marketed in over 100 countries and is the largest selling premium liqueur brand in the world.\n\nMJSE is firmly rooted in Wolfenb\u00fcttel in the German region of Lower Saxony.  The company has produced its globally successful herbal liqueur based on a secret recipe of 56 different herbs, blossoms and roots at this site for over 80 years.  Today, around 900 employees worldwide work for the Wolfenb\u00fcttel-based family company. \n\nFor over 40 years, Mast-J\u00e4germeister US, Inc. (MJUS was formerly known as Sidney Frank Importing Co.) and MJSE have been working in a trusted partnership and together have successfully built J\u00e4germeister to be the top selling liqueur and an iconic brand in the United States market.\n\nSFIC was founded in 1972 by legendary brand builder, Sidney Frank. In 1974, MJSE appointed SFIC as its exclusive importer for the United States. Sidney Frank pursued new and creative ways to promote the brand, and through the introduction of ground breaking initiatives such as The J\u00e4gerettes, bar parties, the J\u00e4germeister Tap Machine and brand sponsored bands, the company fueled sales and turned the little known brand into the number one selling imported liqueur in the United States. \n\nIn 2015, SFIC became a wholly-owned subsidiary of MJUS.  Based in White Plains, New York, the company staffs more than 180 full-time employees and has a network of distributors and brokers throughout the United States. MJUS prides itself on being creative and effective beverage alcohol brand stewards, and encourages a forward-thinking approach to quality brand building, while drawing inspiration from the company's proven success and rich heritage. \n",

La direction reste \u00e9galement tr\u00e8s accessible et transparente dans ses \u00e9changes avec les collaborateurs du cabinet, comme ce fut le cas lors de la p\u00e9riode COVID.

Le cabinet \u00e9coute les souhaits de ses consultants et leurs donne le choix des missions, ce qui n\u2019est pas le cas partout.

    "descriptionHtml": "<strong>About<br><br></strong><strong>About Us: <br><br></strong>We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.<br><br>We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.<br><br>Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays &amp; Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).<br><br><strong>About The Role<br><br></strong>Notion.app is the Electron-based frame through which many of our most active and engaged users experience Notion. We have several Electron core maintainers on our team to drive cross-platform features and would love to add platform-specific expertise - someone who has experience building native macOS applications and is excited about building applications that honor and meet the possibilities of the operating system. This will help us serve our macOS users, including many Notinos, better.<br><br><strong>What You'll Achieve<br><br></strong><ul><li>You'll define the roadmap for macOS features in Notion. </li><li>You'll leverage macOS native audio to allow users to create content on Desktop. </li><li>We value building high quality apps. You'll improve the performance, reliability, and polish of our macOS app. You will also get to work with the web stack to improve the end-to-end experience - for instance by building native Node.js addons in C++, Rust, or Objective-C to allow our web code to hook directly into native UIs and APIs. </li><li>You'll help build and improve internal tools with simplicity and productivity in mind. </li><li>If you're interested, you have the chance to contribute to or become a maintainer of one of the most-used open source projects - Electron, a cross-platform C++ and Objective-C framework. Electron's Objective-C powers 1Password, Figma, Slack, Visual Studio Code, and countless other apps on macOS. Help us make them better! <br><br></li></ul><strong>Skills You'll Need to Bring: <br><br></strong><ul><li>macOS development experience: You have built native macOS applications in the past (ideally with experience using Objective-C) and want to continue working on the platform. </li><li>Enthusiasm to learn TypeScript, React, and Node.js: While ****we are primarily looking for macOS expertise, this role will require working with our web stack. No previous experience is required and we'll provide the guidance and space needed to ramp up. </li><li>Pragmatic and business-oriented: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuff-you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. </li><li>Put users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives.

    "descriptionText": "AboutAbout Us: We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like OpenAI, Toyota, Figma, Ramp, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.Notion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays &amp; Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).About The RoleNotion.app is the Electron-based frame through which many of our most active and engaged users experience Notion. We have several Electron core maintainers on our team to drive cross-platform features and would love to add platform-specific expertise - someone who has experience building native macOS applications and is excited about building applications that honor and meet the possibilities of the operating system. This will help us serve our macOS users, including many Notinos, better.What You'll AchieveYou'll define the roadmap for macOS features in Notion. You'll leverage macOS native audio to allow users to create content on Desktop. We value building high quality apps. You'll improve the performance, reliability, and polish of our macOS app. You will also get to work with the web stack to improve the end-to-end experience - for instance by building native Node.js addons in C++, Rust, or Objective-C to allow our web code to hook directly into native UIs and APIs. You'll help build and improve internal tools with simplicity and productivity in mind. If you're interested, you have the chance to contribute to or become a maintainer of one of the most-used open source projects - Electron, a cross-platform C++ and Objective-C framework. Electron's Objective-C powers 1Password, Figma, Slack, Visual Studio Code, and countless other apps on macOS. Help us make them better! Skills You'll Need to Bring: macOS development experience: You have built native macOS applications in the past (ideally with experience using Objective-C) and want to continue working on the platform. Enthusiasm to learn TypeScript, React, and Node.js: While ****we are primarily looking for macOS expertise, this role will require working with our web stack. No previous experience is required and we'll provide the guidance and space needed to ramp up. Pragmatic and business-oriented: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuff-you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. Put users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact-good and bad. Not ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go. Empathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed. Nice to Haves: You have some experience interacting with the macOS API through Objective-C in a C++/Objective-C cross-compiled code base. A lot of our Objective-C looks a lot like Chrome's Objective-C. You're proficient with other parts of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, Postgres. You've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others-and understand why we're big fans of their work. Our customers come from all walks of life and so do we.
